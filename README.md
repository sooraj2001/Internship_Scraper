# Internship_Scraper

On Internsahla while I was searching for an internship in field of android development.
I applied filter of Android App Development on the website ,it showed internships 
of cross-platform development and native android development both, but I wanted only intenships related to native android.

So I created this program to scrap (<a href="https://internshala.com/internships/android%20app%20development-internship/">Website Link</a>)
the website to display only native android development internships with a duration of less than 3 months
and made this program write all that information on a .txt file on desktop.
The output will get written into InternshipUpdate.txt file on desktop 
Sample Output -
